# Hey there! Welcome to our DVA Assignment repo üëã

We‚Äôre super excited about the datasets we picked for this project. Honestly, we think they‚Äôre a great combo and they let us tell a pretty cool story for our assignment.

Let us walk you through why we chose them and how we‚Äôre planning to tackle the whole thing.

### 1. Why We Picked These Datasets (aka "The Story")

So, here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre working with:

1. **Educational Attainment:** `Educational attainment, at least Bachelor's or equivalent, population 25+, total (%) (cumulative)`
2. **Labor Force Participation:** `Labor force participation rate, total (% of total population ages 15+) (modeled ILO estimate)`

We thought it‚Äôd be interesting to see if more people getting degrees in South Africa actually means more people joining the workforce. Our main question is:

**"As higher education levels go up, does the labor force participation rate change too?"**

Our group‚Äôs hypothesis: If more people have degrees, maybe more people get into the formal workforce. We‚Äôre gonna test this with real data!

### 2. What‚Äôs Up With The Data?

We checked out the World Bank datasets and here‚Äôs what we found:

- **Labor Force Participation Rate:** This one‚Äôs got data for almost every year (like 1990 to 2023). Super consistent!
- **Educational Attainment (Bachelor‚Äôs):** Not so much. It‚Äôs only available for certain years (think 1996, 2001, 2007, 2011, 2016, etc.) because it comes from big surveys or censuses.

Honestly, this is part of the fun! Figuring out how to compare these two is a big part of our project.

## How We‚Äôre Tackling the Assignment

We‚Äôve got enough data to do everything the rubric asks for. Here‚Äôs our plan:

**1. Data Preparation (15 marks)**
- First, we‚Äôll load both datasets.
- We noticed one is yearly and the other is kinda random. So, we‚Äôve got a missing values problem to solve!
- Two ways we can handle this:
    - **Option A (Matching Years):** Only use years where we have *both* education and labor force data. Fewer data points, but super accurate.
    - **Option B (Interpolation):** Fill in the gaps for education data (like forward-fill in Pandas, so 2001‚Äôs value stays until 2007, etc.).
- We‚Äôll also do some basic stats (mean, median, etc.) for both datasets.

**2. Numerical Analysis (20 marks)**
- We‚Äôll use NumPy to check the **correlation** between the two datasets. We‚Äôll do this for both matched years and interpolated data, then compare.
- We‚Äôll also look at how things change between years (percentage change and all that).
- Finally, we‚Äôll explain what our findings mean (like, ‚ÄúHey, we found a strong positive correlation!‚Äù).

**3. Visualisation (20 marks)**
- We‚Äôre planning a cool **line chart** with two y-axes: one for labor participation, one for education, and years on the x-axis.
- Also, a **scatter plot** to show the correlation (education on x, labor force on y, each dot is a year).

**4. Database Integration (20 marks)**
- We‚Äôll set up a simple SQLite database with two tables: `EducationData` and `LaborForceData`, both using `Year` as a key.
- Then we‚Äôll write some SQL `JOIN` queries to pull data for years where both have info. Gotta show off those database skills!

## Wrapping Up

We really think these datasets are a great match for this assignment. They‚Äôre relevant, let us tell a clear story, and give us a real-world data cleaning challenge (which is kinda fun, honestly).

Thanks for checking out our repo! Wish us luck üòÑ
